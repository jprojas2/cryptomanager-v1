# cryptomanager-v1

This is an application made to manage crypto portfolios. It makes selling, buying or changing positions as easy as one click, instead of dealing with the complexity crypto exchanges and limit orders. It currently supports Binance and Kucoin exchanges.

I started this project to learn Flutter. It is ceased development and it is not flawless. If you use it, do it under your own responsibility.
